    "LLM": "A single source from which all flows,\nOne breath that fills the vast expanse of air,\nA unity the ancient spirit knows,\nBeyond the countless shapes that life can wear.\nThe solitary star against the night,\nThe boundless ocean as a single mass,\nOne sun providing warmth and guiding light,\nA moment held within a drop of glass.\nThough separate paths our mortal journeys take,\nAnd difference seems to keep our souls apart,\nThere is one root for consciousness to wake,\nOne silent rhythm beating in the heart.\nSo let us see the one in everything,\nThe harmony that unity can bring."

    "LLM": "How strange it is to stand as but a one,\nA solitary figure in the space,\nBefore the race of myriad has run,\nTo hold within oneself the starting grace.\nFrom out of nothing, something must arise,\nA point unfurling, vast beyond its scope,\nReflecting back into the gazer's eyes,\nA fragile atom filled with boundless hope.\nThis singular beginning, deep and old,\nContains the potential of the all,\nA story waiting eager to unfold,\nResponsive to creation's silent call.\nSo be that 'one', the first, the primal core,\nAnd know the many springs from you and more."

    "LLM": "When silent hours across the dial creep,\nAnd shadows lengthen as the daylight fades,\nWhile fleeting moments promises don't keep,\nAnd youthful bloom yields to the sunburnt glades,\nThen summer's green to autumn's brown will turn,\nThe joyful song gives way to weary sigh,\nAs lessons learned by life we sadly learn,\nAnd watch the numbered minutes hasten by.\nYet 'midst this change, one constant truth I find,\nA steadfast hope the heart will hold secure,\nA quiet strength that calms the troubled mind,\nAnd faith in things that ever shall endure.\nSo though time steals each breath and light away,\nTrue love and spirit triumph o'er decay."
